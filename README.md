# Job-Search-Webapp

Data stored in MongoDB is scraped from Indeed using Node.js and Cheerio.

Code for web crawler is here: https://github.com/hding49/Web-Crawler

Use Angular JS frontend framework to build a single page application
that allow us to search, edit, and delete scraped data;

User will be able to search job postings based on keywords;

User will be able to edit job postings;

User will be able to add custom tags;

User will be able to soft delete scraped data; Soft Delete refers to hide the data
from the User but the data still exists in the database;

In this task, you might need to develop at least 3 types of Restful APIs [GET for
Search, Put for Update and Delete]; You will need to build these APIs using
NodeJS;


run server: node server.js

run angualr app: cd my-app and then ng serve -o
